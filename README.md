# MidEvil Keyboard

In the custom mechanical keyboard world, it's extrely hard to find a keyboard with a numberpad, because apparantly, numberpads are evil.  Well, I'm actually making that up (kind of), but if it was actually true, then this keyboard places that evilness smack dab in the middle.

The MidEvil layout is a spin off of [NoPunIn10Did's Jabberwocky keyboard](https://nopunin10did.com/jabberwocky/).  I personally love this layout because it's split, angled, ortholinear, ISO-friendly, and base-kit-friendly.  For MidEvil, I've removed the F keys, added a numberpad to the middle, and a large 4" 320x480 display on the left to balance the board out.
